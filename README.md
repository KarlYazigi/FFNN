# Feed Forward Neural Network from Scratch


This project implements a neural network completely from scratch using only the NumPy library to optimize calculations. The functionality of this neural network is then demonstrated on a toy problem "finding solutions to polynomial functions". 

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with applying the algorthim to different tasks!

## Model Performance

The model demonstrates impressive performance with an accuracy of 95% on the training set and 93% on the test set.
